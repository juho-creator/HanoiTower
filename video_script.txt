This is a game of tower of hanoi developed in C++ using text based interface.

The game starts with a welcome message. 
Then a prompt message appears asking user to setup the number of rods and disks
User is asked again if an invalid input is entered.
This includes number of rods being less than that of disks, 
and noninteger or negative number being entered.

Once the user sets up the number of rods and disks,
the disks are stacked in descending order of sizes on the first rod, 
with the largest disks stacked at the very bottom and the smallest at the top.

The objective of the game is to move all the disks to another rod in the same descending order.
The user is not allowed to place larger disks on smaller disks or move  from a rod that doesn't exist or with no disks.

Once the user is done playing the game, replay prompt is displayed.
If the user enters "y", game is replayed. otherwise if "n" is entered, the game ends.
